// Problem Description
// Given an unsigned integer N, swap all odd bits with even bits. Every even position bit is swapped 
// with the adjacent bit on the right side and every odd position bit is swapped with adjacent on the
// left side. Assume a 32 bit integer.
// Hint: To avoid negative values caused by integer overflow, utilize BigInt in your JavaScript code 
// for handling large integer computations.BigInt is a JavaScript built-in object used to represent 
// integers larger than the range supported by the Number primitive.

// Sample Input --->
// 22

// Sample Output --->
// 41

// Explanation --->
// The given number is 22 (00010110), it should be converted to 41 (00101001).
